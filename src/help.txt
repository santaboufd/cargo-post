A `cargo` wrapper that executes a post build script after a successful build

USAGE:
    cargo post --help           Show this help message and exit
    cargo post --version        Show version information and exit
    cargo post CMD [ARGS]       Execute `cargo CMD [ARGS]` and run
                                `post_build.rs` afterwards (if it's a build
                                command).

EXAMPLES:
    cargo post build            Builds the crate
    cargo post build --release  Builds the crate in release mode
    cargo post xbuild           Builds the crate using cargo-xbuild
    cargo check                 Checks the crate without executing post_build
